Abstract

1.  Introduction

   Some clients have expensive data connections and would prefer to
   transfer the data needed for a web application from a nearby peer
   instead of via the public internet.  These clients can usually afford
   to transfer small amounts of data, which this specification uses to
   validate the data received from the peer.

2.  Fetching a trusted public key

   Read it from the origin's [OriginPolicy].
